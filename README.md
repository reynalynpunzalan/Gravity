# iDrop
Our system titled "iDrop; WaterWorks Record Management System" may consist of the production of a system both hardware and software.
At the present time, our target client uses the manual recording or inputing of data to a logbook in order to have
a list of present and previous reading of water consumption. Then, they will manually compute the total cost of
the water consumed by each household. Each water-metric owner will be given a small piece of paper that serves as the
receipt of their monthly bill. In connection to this, our grouped proposed a system that provides a proper security 
and consistent data recording using Database Management System and records it in a hardware(arduino uno). This will help the user
to reduce the workload. The system will have two modules; The Admin and The User, that will be having different restrictions. The Admin can
add a user, other admin, print reports, post some announcement, receives data and view all the records. The user (household) will have
their own accounts to visit in order to view their present and previous records of water consumptions, and bills. They can also send comments
and reports to the admin. This system eliminates the essence of having a Reader(Worker) because this will automaticaly sends the record data of the water consumption
of the household by using the said hardware that saved data and send it with the use of internet.
